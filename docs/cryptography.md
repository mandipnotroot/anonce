# Cryptographic composition

Audience: cryptographic reviewers and client implementers.

Status: prospective profiles. No cryptographic protocol is implemented.

## Chosen implementation boundaries

| Purpose | Proposed implementation/profile |
| --- | --- |
| Membership and bulletin signatures | Go `crypto/ed25519`, `crypto/x509`; dedicated keys per purpose |
| Blind tokens | CIRCL `blindsign/blindrsa`; RFC 9474 randomized preparation, SHA-384/PSS, dedicated RSA round keys |
| Submission and reply envelopes | Go `crypto/hpke`; DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256), HKDF-SHA256, ChaCha20-Poly1305, base mode |
| Password hashing and keystore derivation | `golang.org/x/crypto/argon2`, Argon2id |
| Log tree and proofs | `golang.org/x/mod/sumdb/tlog` and signed notes; C2SP checkpoint conventions |
| Randomness | `crypto/rand` through library interfaces |

## Membership and authorization

- Generate keys and CSRs on the device. The CA checks proof of possession and
  membership, issues bounded-lifetime certificates, and publishes signed CRLs.
- Fix extensions, chain rules, serial handling, and revocation freshness before
  implementation. Fail issuance closed without required freshness. Revocation
  cannot identify issued anonymous tokens.
- The application profile does **not** claim byte-for-byte Privacy Pass compatibility.
  Never silently substitute its randomized preparation or RSA modulus policy into
  RFC 9578's registered format.
- Fix canonical token input, domain context, key validation, and vectors before wire code.
- Give all round members the same public key, limit, and context to avoid partitioning
  anonymity. Bind tokens to the common bulletin/profile through reviewed encoding.
- Use independent single-use tokens with fresh randomness, not repeat spends.
  Never encode identity-side slots, counters, or member IDs in tokens.

## Encryption and public proofs

- HPKE base mode avoids identifying sender keys; token verification authorizes submission.
- Bind protocol version, round ID, bulletin/form digest, and purpose through the
  reviewed HPKE context/authenticated-data contract. No custom KEM combiner or signing scheme.
- HPKE alone does not stop replay, hide plaintext length, or guarantee forward secrecy
  while recipient keys remain.
- Publish randomized ciphertext commitments and public artifact hashes, never
  identities or bearer secrets.
- Independently verify signed checkpoints, inclusion, and consistency. Keep admin
  events separate and retain external anchors. One operator's hash chain cannot
  prove history was not rewritten. Strictly bound proof decoding size and work.

## Parameter policy

- Review RSA modulus size; proposed minimum: 3072 bits.
- Separate CA, issuer, bulletin, log, audit, and review keys.
- Reject unknown algorithms and downgrades. No unreviewed fallback.
- Version canonical encodings and strictly bound lengths.
- Use normative specification vectors and independent composition tests.
- Apply [compatibility review](versioning.md) to wire and parameter changes.

## Keystore composition

- Use a versioned, password-derived authenticated envelope. Independently review
  salt, nonce, AEAD, authenticated header, parameter bounds, and file grammar.
- Use random salts. Benchmark Argon2id on native/browser clients; bound imported
  work factors before allocation. OWASP minima are a floor, not a universal setting.
- Never use unauthenticated CBC or a password hash as an encryption format.
- See [key management](key-management.md) for custody and recovery.

## Post-quantum scope

The baseline is classical. ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA have final NIST standards;
Go 1.27 provides HPKE and ML-DSA/X.509, but draft HPKE KEM combinations still need
explicit interoperability handling.

Future profiles require cross-client vectors, tested IDs, import/export tests,
hardware review, and downgrade prevention. RSA blind authorization rules out an
end-to-end post-quantum claim.

## Implementation discipline

- Follow [engineering boundaries](../AGENTS.md#engineering-boundaries). Share Go
  composition across CLI/WASM; do not duplicate primitives in JavaScript.
- Minimize secret copies and clear owned mutable buffers. Go garbage collection,
  JavaScript bridges, strings, storage, and runtime copies prevent complete-erasure
  guarantees. Browser execution is not universally constant-time.
- See [deployment](deployment.md#transport-and-headers) and
  [threat model](threat-model.md#browser-delivery-trust) for delivery controls and limits.
